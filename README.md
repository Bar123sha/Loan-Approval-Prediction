**Loan-Approval-Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other demographic factors.
The main goal is to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process using machine learning models, thereby improving decision-making efficiency.

**⚙️ Key Features**

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand data patterns.

Model training using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

Model evaluation with metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Prediction system that can be extended to deployment.

**🚀 Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

**🔑 Workflow**

Data Collection – Loan dataset is imported and explored.

Data Preprocessing – Missing values handled, categorical variables encoded.

EDA – Visualization of relationships (e.g., income vs. approval, credit history impact).

Model Training – Applied ML models to predict loan approval status.

Model Evaluation – Compared performance across different models.

Prediction – Final trained model used for prediction.

**📊 Results**

The best-performing model achieved X% accuracy (replace with actual result from your notebook).

Credit history, income, and loan amount were identified as the most significant features.
